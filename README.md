# Hey ğŸ‘‹

I am Raphael. At some places of the internet, like here, I am known as raphting.

I grew up in Germany ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª. Now I live in The Netherlands ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±.

My job is to develop backend software in Go and create cloud infrastructure.
I am an independent consultant for security-related software development.

In my non-computer time, I like to sail â›µ. I used to fly small aircraft but paused this hobby for now.
